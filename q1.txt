Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2
http stand for hypertext transfer protocol.
HTTP1.1:
1. http1.1 created in 1997.
2.Http1.1 loads resources one after the other so if one resource cannot be loaded it blocks all the other resources.
3.Small files load more quickly than large ones to speed up web performance http1.1.
4.frist http1 is the method computers and servers use to request and send information.

HTTP2:
1. http2 is created in 2015.
2.http2 is faster and more  efficent then http1.
3.One of the ways in which http2 is faster is in how it prioritizes content during the loading process.
4.Http2 is able to use a single tcp connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.
